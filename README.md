## Project Title: Excel Logistics Issue Resolution

**Description**:

In this project, I addressed customer issues related to delivered items in the logistics dataset, employing Excel for a thorough analysis. The project encompassed the following steps:

1. **Pivot Table Creation**: Utilized Excel's pivot tables to organize and summarize customer issues data, facilitating a structured view of the problems encountered in delivered items.
2. **Data Visualization**: Employed data visualization techniques to create charts and graphs, offering a visual representation of customer complaints and issues. This step aimed to enhance understanding and identify patterns within the dataset.
3. **Issue Resolution**: Leveraged insights from the visualizations to develop targeted solutions for addressing and resolving customer complaints or issues promptly.
